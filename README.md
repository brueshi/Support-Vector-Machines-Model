Support Vector Machines (SVM) are supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks. SVMs find an optimal hyperplane that separates the data into different classes.

Explanation:

We import the SVC class from the sklearn.svm module.
An instance of the SVC class is created.
The classifier is trained on the training data using the fit method.
Finally, we make predictions on the test data using the predict method and store the predicted values in y_pred.
